# Coffeerun
This is a site with a form for ordering coffee with the output of all current orders on the page. The idea and part of the code was taken from a book on learning the frontend. The goal was to practice with technologies such as **jQuery**, **Bootstrap** and **JavaScript (ES6 and ES5)**. In this project, while writing modules, I compared **ES5** and **ES6**. The main differences that I noticed is that **ES6** have class, lambda expressions(=>) and automatic 'strict mode' in classes. In **ES5**, you have to use the **IIFE** pattern to implement class and the bind(), call() methods.

## Technologies
- **jQuery**
- **Bootstrap**
- **JavaScript (ES6 and ES5)**

## Install
